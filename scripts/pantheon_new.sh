# Initialize Live Environment to work around the pantheon.yml hotfix issue.
# https://pantheon.io/docs/pantheon-yml#deploying-hotfixes
# Our deployment process bypasses Pantheon's serial workflow and deploys to
# Live by tagging the production repo master branch with `pantheon_live_N`
# ourselves, which prevents changes in the pantheon.yml file from being
# initialized on the live environment.
#
# This set up step clones the production repo from Pantheon, syncs our code
# the way it would on deployment, then uses terminus to deploy it through the
# Pantheon workflow. After the Live environment is initialized, our parallel
# workflow will deploy without issue.
