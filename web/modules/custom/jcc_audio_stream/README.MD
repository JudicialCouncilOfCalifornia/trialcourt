In order to use this functionality, add an <a> tag with a data attribute of "data-radiomast-id" that equals the UUID of the stream E.G. <a data-radiomast-id="9043c55c-7dec-4a9e-8491-e250c9205d45" href="/">Test</a>
You can find the correct UUID for the individual station by copying it from the iframe on the existing
site or by copying it directly from radiomast.
